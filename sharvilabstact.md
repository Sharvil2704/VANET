**Secure and Cost-Effective Platoon-Based Authentication for VANETs with Conditional Privacy**

* Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) offer significant potential for improving traffic safety and efficiency. However, security and privacy concerns hinder widespread adoption. This paper proposes a novel blockchain-based authentication scheme leveraging conditional privacy within temporary platoons. Our scheme utilizes blockchain technology to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized access, while enabling conditional privacy preservation where data sharing is limited based on pre-defined trust levels within the platoon. This significantly reduces reliance on Roadside Units (RSUs), leading to a cost-effective approach. Compared to traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), our scheme offers improved security, enhanced privacy, and reduced infrastructure costs, promoting wider VANET implementation.
