## System Model
This research proposes a novel concept of temporary platoons within the context of adaptive platoon schemes, addressing the challenge of accommodating differences in intra-platoon vehicle speeds. To qualify as part of a temporary platoon, a new entering vehicle must maintain a predefined proximity to the platoon leader (denoted as L<sub>A</sub>) for a specific duration. This temporal constraint can be enforced through either a transaction timer or by leveraging the intrinsic properties of the Blockchain Network (BN).\\
Adaptive platoon schemes have revolutionized highway transportation, yet their efficiency is impeded by the inherent diversity in vehicle speeds within a platoon. This paper introduces the concept of temporary platoons, emphasizing the significance of proximity maintenance to the designated platoon leader. This innovative approach not only optimizes platoon dynamics but also serves as a mechanism to identify rapidly changing vehicle speeds, subsequently enhancing safety measures.\\
The temporal aspect of temporary platoons is realized through two mechanisms: a transaction-based timer and the inherent features of the Blockchain Network. By imposing a temporal requirement for proximity maintenance, this approach efficiently differentiates between vehicles adhering to platoon norms and those deviating due to speeding or abrupt deceleration.\\
The proposed system provides a robust mechanism for detecting anomalies in vehicle speeds within platoons. Vehicles failing to sustain proximity to multiple platoon leaders trigger alerts, enabling timely warnings to other platoons and mitigating potential accidents on the highway. Furthermore, this concept can be extended to Emergency Services, ensuring their high-speed transit while maintaining safe distances from other vehicles.\\
To incentivize participation in this safety ecosystem, vehicles involved in platoons are encouraged to consolidate information on a private ledger at discrete locations. The use of new pseudonyms ensures the preservation of privacy, thereby fostering cooperation within the network.\\
The integration of temporary platoons into adaptive platoon schemes presents a promising solution to the challenge of variable vehicle speeds within a platoon. The proposed approach not only enhances safety through early anomaly detection but also incentivizes privacy-preserving information sharing among vehicles. Future work may delve into real-world implementations and scalability aspects to further validate the effectiveness of this innovative concept.

In the proposed vehicular communication model, vehicles of the same color are organized into platoons ( i.e. vehicles of same color form a single platoon), each led by a designated leader. Consider a scenario where vehicles A and B are traveling at a speed "s" while a new vehicle, V, enters the scene at a significantly higher speed, denoted as " s' " (s' is much greater than s). Vehicle V forms a temporary platoon with A, but the latter accelerates past A before being officially inducted into Platoon A. Recognizing the potential danger of accidents, the leader of Platoon A promptly records this event and transmits a warning message to other platoons in the vicinity, emphasizing V's erratic behavior and high speed. Platoon B, upon receiving this message, takes preventive action by making way for V to avoid any collision or mishap. In an attempt to establish control, the leader of Platoon B seeks to form a temporary platoon with V, only to witness V speeding past again before integration. The leader of Platoon B transmits a message, recording V's actions and validating the earlier warning from Platoon A. In response, the leader of Platoon A incorporates this information into their own blockchain. Subsequently, in the proximity of a Trust Authority (TA), a member from either Platoon A or B informs the TA about the updated events in their respective chains. The TA stores this information and dynamically adjusts the trust ratings of all involved parties. Furthermore, to safeguard privacy, the TA assigns new pseudonyms to the members who provided information, reinforcing confidentiality in the vehicular communication system. This proposed model demonstrates an effective means of incident reporting, information dissemination, and trust management in vehicular networks, contributing to enhanced safety and privacy protocols.
