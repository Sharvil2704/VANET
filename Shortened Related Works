**1. Protocol for Decentralized Authentication and Dynamic Group Key Agreement:**

- Researchers: Xiaofeng Wang et al.
- Introduced a blockchain-centered protocol designed for authenticating users and establishing group keys dynamically, with the primary goal of reducing computation and communication costs.
- Utilizes one-time signature and blind signature techniques to ensure privacy during authentication.
- Opted for lightweight neighbor authentication rather than full pairwise authentication to enhance efficiency.

**2. Blockchain-based Group Key Agreement Protocol for Internet of Vehicles:**

- Authors: Lei Zhang et al.
- Introduces an asymmetric group key agreement protocol for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) using blockchain technology.
- Introduces a group controller to efficiently manage key updates and reduce overall communication overhead.
- Implements ring signatures for generating group keys and signature aggregation for streamlined verification.

**3. Blockchain-based Partial Group Key Agreement Protocol for Intelligent Transportation Systems:**

- Researchers: Zhenzhen Li et al.
- Proposes a protocol specifically for partial group key agreement, facilitating efficient key updates within dynamic groups.
- Implements blockchain-based certificate revocation lists to manage compromised nodes.
- Optimizes communication costs by selectively sending group key updates to relevant vehicles.

**4. Secure and Efficient Lightweight Group Key Agreement Protocol for VANETs:**

- Authors: Jiashen Li et al.
- Focuses on designing a lightweight protocol tailored for resource-constrained vehicular nodes.
- Incorporates a pre-distributed key scheme and pairwise key establishment for the initial setup of group keys.
- Leverages a one-way chain function for efficient key updates without relying on a central authority.

**5. Secure and Scalable Multi-layer Key Management for Decentralized VANETs:**

- Researchers: Xiaofeng Wang et al.
- Explores a multi-layer key management approach for decentralized VANETs using blockchain.
- Proposes a hybrid key architecture involving group keys and individual pairwise keys for diverse communication scenarios.
- Adopts a hierarchical blockchain structure to enhance key management efficiency and scalability.

**Additionally:**

- Recent developments in enhancing the efficiency and robustness of blockchain-based protocols for vehicular communication include scalability solutions such as sharding and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) protocols.
- **Related Works on Blockchain Conditional Privacy-Preserving Authentication (BCPPA):**
    - The concept of CPPA, as proposed by Raya and Hubaux, addresses security and privacy concerns in VANETs. They presented a CPPA protocol utilizing anonymous certificates and a modified PKI to achieve anonymous authentication. Lu et al. improved this approach with an RSU-based anonymous certificate system.
    - Freudiger et al. and Zhang et al. proposed CPPA protocols with significant storage costs, leading to attempts to design ID-based CPPA protocols. Zhang et al. introduced a Chinese Remainder Theorem-based CPPA Scheme, and Cui et al. designed a robust CPPA protocol suitable for multi-cloud environments.
    - Several Blockchain-based CPPA (BCPPA) protocols have been proposed to overcome PKI-based drawbacks. Lu et al. integrated blockchain and Merkle Patricia Tree, while Zheng et al. adopted pseudonym technology for an ID-based BCPPA protocol with traceable anonymity. These approaches address challenges such as transparency, workload, and compromised certificate authorities.
