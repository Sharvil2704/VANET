# Introduction to VANET
Prioritizing safety remains a key focus in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) with the aim of minimizing accidents, thereby improving traffic conditions and safeguarding lives. In addition to safety considerations, VANETs offer a range of services such as internet access, weather forecasts, and geo-location information, enhancing the overall travel experience with comfort, convenience, and entertainment.

Several committees are actively working on establishing standards for VANETs, including IEEE 1609.x, 802.11p, and Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE). WAVE, organized in a layered architecture, allows devices compliant with IEEE 802.11 to operate in the Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) band. The IEEE 1609 family outlines the architecture, protocol set, and interfaces, ensuring interoperability in the VANET environment, particularly focusing on the security of message exchange.

The VANET architecture comprises hardware and software components, prominently featuring On Board Units (OBUs) installed on vehicles and Road Side Units (RSUs) positioned along roadways. Communication in VANETs is divided into Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), involving direct communication between vehicles, and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), entailing communication with nearby infrastructure.

In VANETs, nodes represent vehicles equipped with radio systems operating in DSRC channels, or roadside equipment facilitating communication with mobile ad hoc vehicular nodes. Roadside units act as gateways, providing access to infrastructures for mobile nodes.

The ad-hoc nature of VANETs involves vehicles equipped with sensors, OBUs, and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), while the infrastructure includes manufacturers, Trusted Third Parties (TTPs), legal authorities, and service providers. RSUs, serving as bridges, connect the infrastructure and ad-hoc environments.

Smart vehicles should incorporate essential sensors, positioning systems like GPS, communication systems with multiple interfaces, a central computing system, and an Event Recording Device (ERD). Suggestions emphasize the significance of Electronic License Plates or Electronic Chassis Numbers for identity representation and streamlined verification/logging processes.

Trust management plays a crucial role in assessing the reliability of vehicles and received messages in vehicular networks to prevent adverse consequences resulting from false emergency messages. While trust management is essential, the combination of reputation certificates and digital signatures is considered a promising research direction. However, existing schemes often neglect privacy preservation, limiting their applicability.

The preservation of privacy emerges as a critical concern in vehicular networks due to potential harm from disclosing privacy-sensitive information. Numerous privacy preservation schemes focus on anonymity, unlinkability, and traceability but often overlook integration with trust management schemes in vehicular networks.

# Introduction to VANET Security
The vehicles in VANET are envisioned to be smart in the following perspectives. First, they should incorporate the basic set of sensors such as front and rear radar that receive extra information from surroundings that the human driver is unable to perceive. Secondly, positioning systems such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) are also found essential for driving assistances. Finally, a smart vehicle should also be equipped with a communication system with potentially multiple interfaces, a central computing system and an Event Recording Device (ERD) whose functioning is similar to the black box of an aircraft. There are also proposals tressing that a smart vehicle should also be equipped with Electronic License Plates or Electronic Chassis Number to better represent the identity of the vehicle and easy the verification and logging process.

Safety in VANETs is of special concern because human lives are constantly at stake whereas in traditional networks the major security concerns include confidentiality, integrity and availability none of which involves primarily with life safety. Vital information cannot be neither modified nor deleted by an attacker. Nonetheless, security in VANET also indicates the ability to determine the driver responsibility while maintaining driver privacy. Information about the vehicles and their drivers within must be exchanged securely and more importantly, timely in that the delay of message exchange may cause catastrophic consequences such as collision of vehicles. The deployment of a comprehensive security system for VANET is very challenging in practice. A security breach of VANET is often critical and hazardous. Moreover, the nature of vehicular network is highly dynamic with frequent and instantaneous arrivals and departures of vehicles as well as short connection durations. In addition to its dynamic nature and high mobility, the use of wireless media also makes VANET vulnerable to attacks that exploit the open and broadcast nature of wireless communication. 

Cryptographic attacks in VANET are categorized in the next section. Besides general networks security issues, unique security challenges rises because of the unique characteristics of VANET such as high mobility, dynamic topology, short connection duration and frequent disconnections. These unique features bring security issues such as trust group formation, position detection and protection as well as certificate management.
# Classification to Attacks
Since the vehicle itself is a sufficient source of electricity, OBU does not have to bear the bottleneck of limited battery life like other mobile devices such as smart phones and wearable devices. Therefore, we can integrate all kinds of processors and chips into the OBU to grant the vehicle workstation Â­scale computing capability. Unfortunately, this advantage is only one side of the coin. Such computational capability also enables attacks that are computationally intensive and are not feasible in normal ad-hoc networks.

Therefore, it is necessary to classify the attacks in VANET because the unique nature of VANET that brings unique vulnerabilities and various kinds of attacks that requires significant computing. The use of a cryptographic based categorization that is easy and plain to understand since the similar approach it takes as done in traditional network security, is proposed.
The major categories are threat and attacks on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. Other categories include attacks on authentication and accountability.
