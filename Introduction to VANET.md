Enhancing safety stands out as a paramount objective in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) due to its potential to reduce accidents, thereby contributing to improved traffic conditions and the preservation of lives. Beyond safety concerns, VANETs offer a spectrum of services, including internet access, weather forecasts, and geo-location information, enriching the travel experience with comfort, convenience, and infotainment.

Various committees are actively engaged in finalizing standards for VANETs, encompassing IEEE 1609.x, 802.11p, and Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE). WAVE, structured as a layered architecture, enables devices compliant with IEEE 802.11 to operate in the Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) band. The IEEE 1609 family delineates the architecture, protocol set, and interfaces, ensuring interoperability within the VANET environment, with a focus on message exchange security.

The VANET architecture encompasses hardware and software components, prominently featuring On Board Units (OBUs) mounted on vehicles and Road Side Units (RSUs) deployed along roadways. Communication in VANETs is categorized into Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), where vehicles communicate directly, and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), involving communication with nearby infrastructure.

In VANETs, nodes represent vehicles equipped with radio systems operating in DSRC channels or roadside equipment facilitating communication with mobile ad hoc vehicular nodes. Roadside units act as gateways, providing access to infrastructures for mobile nodes.

The ad-hoc aspect of VANETs includes vehicles equipped with sensors, OBUs, and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs). In contrast, the infrastructure involves manufacturers, Trusted Third Parties (TTPs), legal authorities, and service providers. RSUs, acting as bridges, connect the infrastructure and ad-hoc environments.

Smart vehicles should integrate basic sensors, positioning systems like GPS, and communication systems with multiple interfaces, a central computing system, and an Event Recording Device (ERD). Proposals highlight the importance of Electronic License Plates or Electronic Chassis Numbers for identity representation and streamlined verification/logging processes.

Trust management plays a pivotal role in evaluating the reliability of vehicles and received messages in vehicular networks, preventing adverse consequences from unreal emergency messages. While trust management is crucial, combining reputation certificates and digital signatures is seen as a promising research direction. However, existing schemes often overlook privacy preservation, limiting their applicability.

Privacy preservation emerges as a critical concern in vehicular networks due to the potential harm caused by disclosing privacy-sensitive information. Numerous privacy preservation schemes focus on anonymity, unlinkability, and traceability but often neglect the integration with trust management schemes in vehicular networks.

# Introduction to VANET Security
First, they should incorporate the basic set of sensors such as front and rear radar that receive extra information from surroundings that the human driver is unable to perceive. Secondly, positioning systems such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) are also found essential for driving assistances. Finally, a smart vehicle should also be equipped with a communication system with potentially multiple interfaces, a central computing system and an Event Recording Device (ERD) whose functioning is similar to the black box of an aircraft. There are also proposals tressing that a smart vehicle should also be equipped with Electronic License Plates or Electronic Chassis Number to better represent the identity of the vehicle and easy the verification and logging process.
Cryptographic attacks in VANET are categorized in the next section. Besides general networks security issues, unique security challenges rises because of the unique characteristics of VANET such as high mobility, dynamic topology, short connection duration and frequent disconnections. These unique features bring security issues such as trust group formation, position detection and protection as well as certificate management.
# Classification to Attacks
Since the vehicle itself is a sufficient source of electricity, OBU does not have to bear the bottleneck of limited battery life like other mobile devices such as smart phones and wearable devices. Therefore, we can integrate all kinds of processors and chips into the OBU to grant the
vehicle workstation Â­scale computing capability. Unfortunately, this advantage is only one side of the coin. Such computational capability also enables attacks that are computationally intensive and are not feasible in normal ad-hoc networks. The major categories are threat and attacks on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. Other categories include attacks on authentication and accountability.
