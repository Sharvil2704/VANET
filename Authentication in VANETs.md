Vehicular Communications represent a paradigm shift in the realm of transportation technology, poised to reshape the way we perceive and interact with our road networks. At its core, it harnesses the power of connectivity to create a dynamic ecosystem where vehicles, infrastructure, and network services seamlessly exchange information, enabling a host of transformative capabilities. Through Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and communication channels, VANET systems empower vehicles to communicate not only with each other but also with Roadside Unit (RSU) or Trusting Authority(TA). This interconnectedness forms the foundation for a multitude of applications, ranging from real-time traffic management to enhanced navigation assistance and proactive safety measures.

Yet, amid the promise of this interconnected future lies a pressing concern: the security and integrity of these communication channels. As VANET technologies proliferate and become more deeply integrated into our transportation systems, the need to ensure the authenticity and trustworthiness of communication becomes paramount. This is where authentication mechanisms come into play.

Authentication within the VANET context involves the rigorous verification of the identities of communicating entities. It serves as a safeguard against malicious actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities within the communication infrastructure. By verifying the legitimacy of message sources and ensuring the integrity of transmitted data, authentication mechanisms mitigate the risk of various nefarious activities, including spoofing attacks, data manipulation, and unauthorized access. Authentication is crucial for ensuring trust in communication, especially when a RSU/TA is prepared to receive messages from other vehicles in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks. The process involves vehicles signing messages, which are then verified by intelligent communication infrastructure. However, in typical VANET scenarios, vehicles communicate in wireless environments that may lack security, necessitating the protection of users' privacy. Hence, numerous anonymous identity authentication schemes are offered to safeguard vehicle users' privacy. Additionally, considering the high-speed movement and numerous waiting nodes in metropolitan areas, authentication processes should be brief to meet stringent time requirements. Security concerns arise due to wireless communication, allowing adversaries to modify, intercept, or delete messages transmitted in VANETs. Therefore, recipients must verify message integrity and the sender's identity beforehand to prevent information misinterpretation or potential threats to driver safety. Privacy concerns involve adversaries capturing a vehicle's travel route by analyzing broadcast messages, posing a risk to driver privacy and potentially enabling criminal activities. Anonymity technology is crucial for protecting drivers' privacy in VANETs, but it presents challenges, as adversaries with anonymous identities may maliciously release messages without accountability. Traceability and unlinkability are essential features to enable the trusted authority to reveal a vehicle's real identity when necessary while preventing other vehicles from inferring a vehicle's identity from its messages. This ensures accountability, especially in cases of malicious behavior where identifying and punishing the driver is crucial. Several conditional privacy-preserving protocols have been proposed to address security and privacy issues in VANETs, with traditional PKI-based authentication being complex and resource-intensive due to the management of numerous certificates and authentication messages.

Furthermore, the proliferation of connected vehicles amplifies the potential impact of security breaches within VANET networks. As vehicles become increasingly reliant on interconnected systems for navigation, communication, and autonomous driving functions, the consequences of security lapses grow more severe. Unauthorized access to vehicle systems or tampering with critical data could have catastrophic implications, ranging from traffic disruptions to potential accidents or even malicious remote takeovers.

In light of these challenges, the development and deployment of robust authentication mechanisms are essential to fortify VANET infrastructures against evolving threats. By ensuring the authenticity and integrity of communication channels, authentication mechanisms form the cornerstone of a secure and resilient VANET ecosystem. They instill confidence in the reliability of VANET services, fostering trust among stakeholders and enabling the realization of the full potential of connected vehicle technologies.
