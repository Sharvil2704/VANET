While Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) can potentially improve driver safety and traffic management efficiency (e.g. through timely sharing of traffic status among vehicles), security and privacy are two ongoing issues that need to be addressed. Hence, security solutions such as A Blockchain-based Privacy-Preserving Authentication Scheme for Secure Vehicular Communications have been proposed. The proposed model is an extended model based on Temporary Blockchain Platoons Formation. This model is Cost Effective in terms of Infrastructure established and includes 'Accident Prevention Mechanism'. Apart from the extra proposed features, rest features and mechanisms will be working as in already present Platoon Model.
